# Awesome-Quiz-App-With-Timer

I created this awesome quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to challenge and entertain users. Here's a breakdown of how I put it all together:

# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

In the HTML file, I set up the structure of the web page. I created different sections for the quiz, information box, and result box. I used HTML to define buttons, titles, question texts, and options, making sure everything is properly organized within divs and sections.

I also linked external CSS and JavaScript files to style the page and add interactivity.

# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

To give the quiz app a visually appealing look, I used CSS extensively. I started by importing a Google font for a modern typeface. Then, I defined a dark-themed background and text colors to create an engaging atmosphere. I styled buttons, info boxes, quiz boxes, options, and result boxes to make them user-friendly.

I made use of transitions and animations to create smooth user experiences when elements appear or change state.

# JavaScript:

The heart of the project lies in JavaScript. I used it to add interactivity and functionality to the quiz app. When a user clicks "Start Quiz," JavaScript activates the information box, which explains the rules. The "Continue" button then hides the information box and starts the quiz.

I set up timers to limit each question to 15 seconds, added logic to handle correct and incorrect answers, and kept track of the user's score.

JavaScript dynamically loads questions and options from a separate JavaScript file, ensuring that the quiz is easily expandable with more questions.

When the quiz ends, JavaScript displays the result, congratulating the user if they scored well or encouraging them to try again if they didn't. Users can replay or quit the quiz with buttons that JavaScript manages.

Overall, this project combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity to create a fun and engaging quiz application. It's a perfect way to challenge and entertain users while testing their knowledge!
